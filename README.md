## üöÄ Projects

Here are some projects that I am proud to have worked on or am currently working on:

09/2023 -> 11/2023 - **Acoustic Pollution Control: Solving Helmholtz equation and Ruppert Algorithm**
   - Created a Ruppert algorithm from scratch in Python.
   - Analyzed solutions and eigenvalues of the Helmholtz equation.
   - [Solving Helmholtz equation and Ruppert Algorithm](https://github.com/edward-lucyszyn/acoustic-pollution-control)

2. **Capped Project of Acoustic Pollution Control**
   - Given a precise quantity of porous material, found the optimal location to reduce noise.

3. **Predicting Stocks Behavior with an Agent Based Model (ABM) Model**
   - Computed the best coefficients to make the model fit real-world stock changes over the past 10 years.
   - Analyzed investment strategies employed over the past five decades.
   - Tested our model with recent data, achieving an accuracy rate of 60%.
   - [Predicting Stocks Behavior: Agent Based Model Calibration](https://github.com/edward-lucyszyn/agent-based-model-calibration)

4. **Analysis of Road Traffic Around Paris-Saclay University**
   - Used a program called SUMO - Simulation of Urban Mobility.
   - Analyzed traffic jams and created new roads to reduce average travel time.

5. **Algorithm for a Game Called 'Pylos'**
   - Coded a heuristic for the game.
   - [Winning Algorithm for the game Pylos](https://github.com/edward-lucyszyn/algorithm-for-pylos)

6. **Mini Blockchain**
   - Created a minimum viable product (MVP) of a blockchain following the Understanding Blockchain course with 5 other people.
   - [BikeChain](https://github.com/edward-lucyszyn/understand-blockchain-project)
