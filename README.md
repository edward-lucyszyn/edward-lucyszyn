Passionate about mathematics from an early age, I like thinking about scientific problems and seeking creative ideas. 

Regarding my education, I attended scientific preparatory classes at Lyc√©e Carnot for two years before joining CentraleSup√©lec, an engineering school in France that is part of the Universit√© Paris-Saclay. During my two years at CentraleSup√©lec, I pursued a Master of Science in Engineering, specializing in mathematical modeling, and took courses in theoretical mathematics, applied mathematics, computer science, and finance. Instead of completing my third year there, I decided to pursue a dual degree by enrolling in the Master of Science in Operations Research program at Columbia University, specializing in applied mathematics, data science, and finance.
