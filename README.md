Passionate about mathematics and computer science from an early age, I pursued scientific preparatory classes at Lycée Carnot before joining CentraleSupélec, one of the top engineering schools in France and part of the Université Paris-Saclay. During my two years at CentraleSupélec, I pursued a Master of Science in Engineering, specializing in finance and probabilities, taking courses in stochastic finance, risk modeling, optimization, and machine learning.

I have been involved in various practical projects, including implementing and optimizing investment strategies with BNP Paribas Asset Management and analyzing financial markets. Additionally, I conducted a research study in mathematics to reduce acoustic pollution from aircraft engines and created a mobile application from scratch for a Junior Enterprise project.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Management Science and Engineering at Columbia University, taking courses such as quantitative corporate finance and optimization models.

I am actively seeking a summer internship in finance or software engineering.

Skills: Python, SQL, LaTeX, Git and server administration, R, Dart, JavaScript, React 

## 🚀 Projects

Here are some projects that I am proud to have worked on or am currently working on:
