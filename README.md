Passionate about mathematics and computer science from an early age, I pursued scientific preparatory classes at Lyc√©e Carnot before joining CentraleSup√©lec, one of the top engineering schools in France and part of the Universit√© Paris-Saclay. During my two years at CentraleSup√©lec, I pursued a Master of Science in Engineering, specializing in finance and probabilities, taking courses in stochastic finance, risk modeling, optimization, and machine learning.

I have been involved in various practical projects, including implementing and optimizing investment strategies with BNP Paribas Asset Management and analyzing financial markets. Additionally, I conducted a research study in mathematics to reduce acoustic pollution from aircraft engines and created a mobile application from scratch for a Junior Enterprise project.

I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Management Science and Engineering at Columbia University, taking courses such as quantitative corporate finance and optimization models.

I am actively seeking a summer internship in finance or software engineering.

### Projects

#### 1. **Stochastic Finance Risk Modeling Project**

As part of my coursework at CentraleSup√©lec, I worked on a project that aimed to optimize an investment portfolio using financial data. With a team, we applied **Markowitz's portfolio theory** to maximize returns while minimizing risk, analyzing data from the **S&P 500**. We evaluated risk through measures such as **Expected Shortfall** and **Entropic Value at Risk**. Our findings provided insights into managing risk under extreme market conditions. This project was carried out in collaboration with BNP Paribas Asset Management.

#### 2. **Pylos AI Player**

For the course "Computational Approach to Games" at CentraleSup√©lec, I developed an AI player for the **Pylos** board game using the **ALPHABETA algorithm**. The project involved implementing a heuristic function to optimize the AI's strategy and improve its performance. I was awarded one of the highest grades in this project, indicating the effectiveness of the AI I developed.
